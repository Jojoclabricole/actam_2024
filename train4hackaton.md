# ACTAM: Hackathon preparation

## 09/10/2024

---

## Class outline

- Hackathon rules
- Demo live performance

- Break (10 min)

- Exercising together

---

## Hackathon rules - What to do?

You will be given an existing track or a musical idea that we suggest (earn up to 3 points)

- Option 1: Play in class a **live performance** of a version/attempt/interpretation of the given track.
- Option 2: Code an end-to-end version/attempt/interpretation of the given track and **sumbit the codebase** to us.

With either option, you will be asked to complete the other one at home and send us either the codebase or a screen capture of your performance.

---

## Things to consider

- you can work in group of 2-4 (but not more)
- you can work from home
- you can prepare a mental structure of your performance (no improvisation skills needed)
- if you can't attend the hackathon don't worry, you can send us a screencapture of your performance.

---

## Evaluation criteria

- Originality or (apparently paradoxically) extreme fidelity to the original version (if it's a reinterpretation)
- Code structure (e.g. modularization, reusability of components) based on the music idea.
- Performance smoothness (no skipping, no stopping, etc.)
